That was a two-part thing.
- After 40, I don't think "type" matters that much for introductions. We meet people, we make friends (or not), and decide where to go from there. You're an adult, so it's not like I'm a chapperone that hands you off to someone else.
- I'm separated, so on my end, I don't see an issue with inviting you to come hang out with us. We take the dogs out almost every weekend. If you were attached, it would be weird.
